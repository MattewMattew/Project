    m_Localized: "The first move is made by the captain, then the right to move is
      transferred clockwise. Each turn consists of three phases:\r\n<b>1. Kit\r\n</b>\r\nTake
      the top two cards from the deck into your hand. If the deck runs out of cards,
      shuffle the discard pile and make a new deck.\r\n<b>2.</b> Draw\r\n\r\n</b>\r\nYou
      may play any number of cards to help yourself or harm members of the Syndicate.
      As a general rule, you only play cards on your turn (with the exception of
      Pass! and Beer cards). You have the right to play as many cards as you want
      (including not playing any), but you must comply with three restrictions:\r\nYou
      cannot play more than 1 Bang! per turn (this rule does not apply to other cards
      with a symbol).\nYou must not have multiple cards with the same name in the
      game (maximum one of each).\r\nYou can only have 1 weapon in play (when playing
      a new weapon card, discard the previously placed one).\r\nThere are two types
      of game cards: one-time cards (with a red frame) go to the discard pile after
      use, and permanent cards (with a blue frame) remain in the game.\nWhen you
      play a single card, discard it from your hand to the discard pile and apply
      all of its effects (as indicated by text or symbols). When you play a permanent
      card, place it faceup in front of you (\u201CJail\u201D in front of another
      player). The cards in front of you are in play, and their effects last forever
      until the card is discarded (for example, with Pretty Woman) or leaves the
      game in some other way (for example, with Dynamite). You can keep as many cards
      as you want in play, but they must all be different. Important: in this phase,
      you cannot discard a card (one-time or permanent) without applying its effect.
      You can discard cards during the discard phase and only if the hand limit is
      exceeded.\n<b>3. Reset\r\n</b>\r\nIf you don't want to or can't play any more
      cards, the play phase ends and you must discard any excess cards from your
      hand. The hand limit is equal to the number of ammo (health) remaining at the
      end of the turn. Discard all cards above this limit and pass to the left.\r\nDistance
      between players The distance from one player to another is equal to the number
      of gaps between them, counting to the nearest side around the table (see diagram).
      Many cards only work at a certain distance. For example, at the beginning of
      the game, you only have a Colt with the symbol from your weapon, so you can
      only reach a target - a player or a card - at a distance of 1. Eliminated players
      do not count towards the distance calculation: if someone's character dies,
      the rest become closer to each other. friend.\r\n<b>4.Character's death</b>\r\n</b>\nWhen
      your character loses his last life point, you may immediately play a Beer card
      (see below) and save a life. If you do not have a Beer card, your character
      dies and you are out of the game. When out of the game, reveal your role card
      and discard all your cards from your hand and from the game.\n<b>5.Penalties
      and rewards</b>\n</b>\nIf the captain kills an assistant, the captain must
      discard all his cards from his hand and from the game. Any player who kills
      a member of the Syndicate (even if they themselves are a member of the Syndicate)
      will receive 3 cards in their hand."

      a) Death of
      the captain. If only the renegade is left alive at the table, he wins, otherwise

      b) The reign of order. If all members
      of the Syndicate and the renegade are killed, the captain and his assistants
      win.


      Example 1. All members of the Syndicate are knocked out, but the
      renegade is still alive. The game continues: now the renegade will have to
      confront the captain and his assistants alone.


      Example 2. The captain
      is killed, but all members of the Syndicate are destroyed. Only the renegade
      and the assistant captain remained in the game. The party ends with the victory
      of the members of the Syndicate: they have achieved their goal, albeit at the
      cost of their own lives!'

    m_Localized: 'You can only reach a target without a weapon at a distance of 1,
      that is, at your neighbor on the right or left. To hit a target from a greater
      distance, you need to play a more advanced weapon: place its card on your player
      board on top of the Colt. The weapon card can be identified by a blue border
      without bullet holes, a black and white illustration, and a number in the scope
      that indicates the maximum attack distance. A played weapon replaces the Colt
      until its card leaves play. Your weapons in the game can, for example, be stolen
      (with the "Theft" card) or discarded (with the help of "Threat"). But the good
      old Colt you will not lose under any circumstances. You can only keep one weapon
      in play: if you want to play a new one, discard the old one. Important: the
      weapon does not change the distance between the players, but sets the maximum
      distance at which you can hit the opponent. "PP" allows you to play as many
      cards as you want in one move'
